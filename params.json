{"name":"Skyfall","tagline":"MathHarbor's last iteration","body":"## Skyfall\r\n\r\nSkyfall was the last iteration we worked on, while running [MathHarbor](http://hq.mathharbor.com) as a commercial product. It was essentially the backend that would help users start sandboxed IPython kernels for mathematical and scientific computing.\r\n\r\n### Current status\r\n\r\nThe code is extremely buggy, and probably doesn't work anymore. It will need significant rewrites to get anywhere. The project will probably be abandoned in favor of a new codebase, preferably in Javascript. Skyfall's just been put up here out in the open, and for all you know, some part of the codebase might help you somewhere. \r\n\r\n### Still want to wade in?\r\n\r\nContact me [here](http://rudimk.github.io/contact), and I'll help you get started.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
