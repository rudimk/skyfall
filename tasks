- add login and registration forms to respective templates. hook them up with routes in app.py, to enable login and registration. also work on billing models. --- login and registration work, although registration needs to be patched, passwords are being stored as plaintext and not salted hashes. note - this bug has now been fixed. also, need to add a check in the registration route, to look up the db to see if the new registrant already exists in the db or not. --done.

- write code to store keys containing the subdomain and port for a particular kernel, in redis, for hipache. see https://bitbucket.org/mathharbor/shipyard/src/200556899dbb7ecccd92a4810ecd8f797319aba7/containers/views.py?at=master#cl-93 for more details.
